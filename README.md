--> Encoding Caterogical data is a technique of feature transformation.

--> In order to perform Encoding on the input columns we should also know the categories of the data.

--> Generally the data is classified into two types

               1)Numerical Data

               2)Categorical Data

--> So Machine Learning Algorithms can only understand the numeric data and not the catregorical data, so we encode the categorical data.

--> To Encode the categorical data, Categorical data classified into two types.

                            . Nominal Categorical data

                            . Ordinal Categorical data

--> Based on these two categories we have different types of techniques

                              1) Ordinal Encoding 

                              2) Label Encoding

                              3) One Hot Encoding

**Ordinal Encoding**

--> Ordinal Encoding is a technique for ordinal categorical data

--> Ordinal Encoding is used to transform the string data and orders the data based on the categories in the data.

---> Ordinal Encoding class is present in sklearn.preprocessing library

**Label Encoding**

--> Label Encoding is a technique used for nominal categorical data.

--> Label Encoding used to encode the output columns in the data.

--> Label Encoding class is present in scikit.preprocessing library.
